# Digital_Note_Taker
The Digital Note Taker uses express and heroku for the user to be able to create notes on their digital device without having to pull a pen and paper.

## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command(s):
npm install express 
This is only after you already have a package.json file in your application. If not run:
npm init

## Usage
This program is used like a regular to-do list. Once in the site, hit the plus sign on the top right and type a note out and then hit the floppy disk sign on the top right to save your note. If you would like to delete your note, then hit the trash can icon next to the note's title you want to delete.
